# Welcome to my First React.js Profile Page

## Overview
Decided to a create a new profile site using React.js in time for showcase at the She Codes Plus Showcase on 18 April 2023

## Link:
- My live website: https://yessy-lee.netlify.app/

## Theme:
- Simple dark and purple theme to showcase my versatility in design for both dark and light themes
- Purple is my favourite colour, I have implemented light purple on my first profile webpage using pure html/CSS, so would like to show something different that are still incorporating purple theme.

## Library and extensions:

- Build using React, Javascript, TailwindCSS, html/CSS
- Extensions: uuid, react-scroll, react-icons, react-typed, formspree

## Work in Progress

There are a few things that I still need to add as follow - here as a reminder to myself as well:
- Create a functional "Contact Form" - as backend wasn't setup for this purpose, will fix this after the showcase
