# Welcome to my First React.js Profile Page

## Overview
Decided to a create a new profile site using React.js in time for the She Codes Plus Showcase on 18 April 2023. I hope you like my new profile page, any feedback are welcome ðŸ’œ

## Link
- My live website: https://yessy-lee.netlify.app/

## Theme
- Simple dark and purple theme to showcase my versatility in designing both dark and light themes webpages
- Purple is my favourite colour, I have implemented light purple on my first profile webpage using pure html/CSS, so would like to show something different that are still incorporating the vibrant purple colours.

## Library and extensions

- Built using React, Javascript, HTML
- Styled with TailwindCSS, HTML/CSS
- Extensions: uuid, react-scroll, react-icons, react-typed, formspree

## Work in Progress

There are a few things that I still need to add as follow - here as a reminder to myself as well:
- Create a functional "Contact Form" - as backend wasn't setup for this purpose, will fix this after the showcase
- Add more projects when ready
